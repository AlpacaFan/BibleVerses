BibleVerses
===========

Programs in multiple programming languages to display a random Bible Verse of the Day!

# Introduction

When I first started programming back in 1995 I promised to create a "Bible Verse of the Day" program with my brand new Borland C++ V4.5 compiler. Unfortunately I never did.

Years later I finally decided it is something I should do! So I have decided to create a "Bible Verse of the Day" in a couple of programming languages I have used over the years (and some new ones)!

# Database

The programs all use the UNIX fortune text file format. None of them require the random access database file. I have included the entire King James Version downloaded from http://sf.net/projects/fortunebible/.

# Use

All programs expect as first parameter a file name in the fortune format. I have tried to stick to the standards in each programming language - so the code should be portable.  

# Versions

+ Pascal - Created using Free Pascal
+ C      - Created in Notepad++ and Coding Ground (while I was waiting for Visual Studio to install)
+ Node.JS - Created in Notepad++. The current version is synchronous (which is not the Node.JS way!).
+ Java   - Created in Eclipse
